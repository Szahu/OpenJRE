# OpenJRE - Open Java Rendering Engine

OpenJRE is an open source Java project, built on [lwjgl3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3), which hopefully one day will become OpenGL (maybe other rendering API) based rendering engine for various applications. 

## Open Source!

Everyone is invited to join the project, regardless of your programming experience or prior 3D rendering knowledge, you can be a part of this initiative too! 
Feel free to add your own brick to this project by doing a pull request, even the smallest contributions like commenting the code are welcome. You can find all wanted features in the **Projects** tab of this GitHub repository.

## Learning Sources 

Here are some learning sources for OpenGL and lwjgl in general: 
- [lwjgl/OpenGL guide](https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/chapter01/chapter1.html)
- [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) , a good source on OpenGL, however in C++ (OpenGL concepts are the same).
